# Propcheck Examples

Whenever I end up using PropCheck for something I have to relearn how to do
stuff. This repo is designed to be a set of examples for using propcheck in
Elixir. Designed really to illustrate various tasks that I might want to do.

This is not something that will be installed via mix as much as something that
you will cut and paste from and customize to your actuall needs.

Pull requests for new tests welcome!
